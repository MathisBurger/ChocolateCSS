# Information

---
ChocolateCSS is an lightweight scss libary, I build for use
in my personal projects. I wanted to learn more about professional web design. Furthermore I my intention behind this project was, to get rid of css boilerplate code.<br>
ChocolateCSS is not made for beginners. It is especially made for people, who want to design their web pages or apps very fast. But you need at least a bit of css experience.

<strong>NOTE:</strong> This libary is made for the development of dark themes. It is quite hard to build light themes with it.

# Installation

---
Latest release: 
<a href="https://github.com/MathisBurger/ChocolateCSS/releases/download/v1.0.0-beta/">Download</a>

CSS:
```css
@import url("https://github.com/MathisBurger/ChocolateCSS/releases/download/v1.0.0-beta/chocolate.min.css");
```

HTML:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://github.com/MathisBurger/ChocolateCSS/releases/download/v1.0.0-beta/chocolate.min.css">
```

<strong>NOTE:</strong> You need following line of code in your `head` tag. If you do not, the whole responsive design will not work.

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
```

Now unzip the scripts.zip and place the `js/` folder whereever you want.
It is important, because you will need these scripts for further functionalities of the libary.

# Scripts

---
If you are using some functionallity, that requires javascript, you will need to add these scripts:

Navbar:
```html
<script src="js/navbar-toggler.js"></script>
```

Sidebar:
```html
<script src="js/sidebar-toggler.js"></script>
```
