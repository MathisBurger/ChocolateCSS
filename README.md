# Information

---
ChocolateCSS is an lightweight scss libary, I build for use
in my personal projects. I wanted to learn more about professional web design. Furthermore I my intention behind this project was, to get rid of css boilerplate code.<br>
ChocolateCSS is not made for beginners. It is especially made for people, who want to design their web pages or apps very fast. But you need at least a bit of css experience.

<strong>NOTE:</strong> This libary is made for the development of dark themes. It is quite hard to build light themes with it.
