# Information

---
ChocolateCSS is an lightweight scss libary, I build for use
in my personal projects. I wanted to learn more about professional web design. Furthermore I my intention behind this project was, to get rid of css boilerplate code.<br>
ChocolateCSS is not made for beginners. It is especially made for people, who want to design their web pages or apps very fast. But you need at least a bit of css experience.
