# Flex documentation

This part of the documentation will show you, how to use the
built in flex system of ChocolateCSS.

# Container

---

If you want to use container you can just use the `container` class group.
There are three different members of this group.

- `container-sm`
- `container-md`
- `container-md`

The difference between them is their width. `container-lg` fills the whole viewport. You can play arround a bit with them.
<strong>NOTE:</strong> Of course, you will need to add your own flex design, because these classes are not made for general use.


# Row

---

As the `container` group, the `row` group has three members.

- `row-sm`
- `row-md`
- `row-lg`

They are working equal to the `container` classes. The sizes are the same. The only difference is the `flex-direction`. As the name of the group says, the `row` group are displaying rows with a static width.
